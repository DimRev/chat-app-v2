# üöÄ Chat App

**Chat App** is a group chat platform where you can create chat rooms, invite members, and connect with others. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for managing group communications. **Future updates** will include audio and video chat functionalities. This is a work-in-progress project, with new features being implemented as I learn new technologies.
